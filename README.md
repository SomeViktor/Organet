# Organet
This is heavily work in progress. As of the current state, only the concept of the organet and a fully working SoftwareUART class exist. The SoftwareUART Class can send and receive bytes, in the future it is to be encapsulated by the comhelper component and the comhelper to be used by the organet class.
